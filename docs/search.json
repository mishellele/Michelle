I’ve created this website through coding skills I’ve honed during two semesters of bioinformatics at my Alma mater, UMass Amherst. No, my major wasn’t in computer science if that’s what you’re wondering. I currently have a B.S in biology, but I choose to code on the side as a fun little hobby. Actually, I have many hobbies that interest me and you can click here to find out what they are.\nClick here to learn more about me."

Growing up in a town as diverse as Randolph meant that everyone was different, including me, and somehow that made fitting in easier; the similarities each culture holds made us feel more connected than disconnected. It wasn’t until I got to college, where I found myself in a predominantly white space for the first time, that I realized how special my upbringing was. For the first time, I stood out in a way that felt unfamiliar.\nI don’t often update my linkedin… www.linkedin.com/in/michellele2002"
