# New England

I grew on up in a town on the outskirts of Boston, MA. If you look at a map, you'll see that this town – just south of Boston – is called Randolph. But if you ask me, I'd simply call it home. Born in Boston and raised in Randolph, I can confidently say I'm a Massachusetts – at least, until my time at UMass Amherst introduced me to western Mass.

During college, I was often asked, 'Where are you from?'. My answer was always 'Boston.' But over time, I found myself transitioning to 'Randolph,' realizing that overlooking the town where I actually grew up felt like diminishing identity.
