## Where I'm From

I grew up in a town on the outskirts of Boston, MA. If you look at a map, you'll see this town just south of Boston labelled as 'Randolph'. But if you ask me, I'd simply call it home. Born in Boston and raised in Randolph, I like to say I'm a proud Massachusetts local...until I attended UMass Amherst that I truly discovered the existence of Western Mass.

During college people often asked, "Where are you from?". For a while, I'd respond with "Boston" because lets be honest, no one outside of Massachusetts knows where Randolph is. But over time, I found myself answering "Randolph," realizing that overlooking the town I was raised in felt like dismissing a core part of my identity.

## Randolph Public Schools

For me, Randolph Public Schools (RPS) were more than just a place for educationâ€”it introduced me to different cultures I hadn't known existed beyond my own. Growing up in a town as diverse as Randolph meant that everyone was different, including me, and somehow that made fitting in easier; the similarities each culture holds made us feel more connected than disconnected. It wasn't until I got to college, where I found myself in a predominantly white space for the first time, that I realized how special my upbringing was. For the first time, I stood out in a way that felt unfamiliar.
