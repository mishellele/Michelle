I grew on up in a town by the outskirts of Boston, MA. Looking at a map, this town that's south of Boston is known as Randolph, but if you were to ask me, I'd call it home. Born in Boston and raised in Randolph, I can confidently say I'm native to Massachusetts, well, at least not until my exposure to western Mass where I attended college at UMass Amherst.

Growing up with Randolph's public school system made me appreciate the diversity I was exposed to at an early age.
